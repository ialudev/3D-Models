# Summary

A tube-shaped alarm-clock based on an earlier design made from a plumbing tube. The Tube integrates a speaker meant to fit in halogen light fixture holes with a diameter of about 80mm. The clock has one big snooze button as well as 3 smaller buttons used to set the alarm functions. 

The front 7 Segment display is a .56" 7-segment I2C display module. The alarm is generated by a I2S class-d audio amp module. Everything is driven by an esp8266 module and a 5v mains voltage psu module is integrated into the case and is separated by an insert from the low voltage electronics. I have used a non-3d printed "figure-8" power connector for my design but it should be easy to make a plate to connect a fixed Power cable if you cannot get the right type. 

I have included the .scad files so you can easily modify the parts for your own stuff should you need to. I recommend putting 1mm self-adhesive rubber sheeting into the indentations in the base - thats what they are meant for after all but as always with my builds this is not a requirement and optional.
 


# Print Settings

Printer: CTC Prusa i3
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: .2
Infill: 40%-100%

Notes: 
my models always need cooling fans on the printer to print best - sorry. Also Orientation matters - the "foot" model prints best standing on the front/back and will throw a few loops while printing but nothing should be visible on the outside in the end.
